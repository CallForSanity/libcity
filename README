BUILD
  For building the library just write

    make

  This will build both the staticaly  and dynamicaly linked versions
  and also extract headers from source directory into include/.

DOCUMENTATION
  Documentation can be extracted from the source codes with doxygen.

    make doc

  Will create documentation into doc/ folder.

INSTALLING
  In order to install this library to your linux-based
  operating system you can use the generic Makefile,
  that is supplied.

  Write 
    make  
  to compile the code and
    sudo make install
  to install the binaries to /usr/local/bin and
  header files /usr/local/include.

  You might have to hack the Makefile a little to
  make it work on some platforms (like windows, Mac OS and such).

TESTING
  Unit tests for the library are available in the test/ subdirectory. The
  UnitTest++ framework is required to run them. Specify path to frameworks
  library and headers in Makefile.

  In order to be able to build tests correctly, UnitTest++ framework
  must be installed or an include and link path must be set in the
  Makefile. See UNITTESTCPP_LIB and UNITTESTCPP_INCLUDE_DIR variables.
